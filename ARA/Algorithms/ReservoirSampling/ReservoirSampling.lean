# Reservoir sampling (Algorithm R, k = 1)

Sample one element uniformly at random from a list in a single pass,
without knowing its length in advance: keep the `i`-th element seen
with probability `1/i`, replacing the current sample.

## Architecture

As for `Quicksort`/`Quickselect`, a single definition parameterized by
`RandMonad` and `MonadCost` serves as executable program (`M = IO`),
as specification (`M = PMF`), and as timed algorithm
(`M = TimeMT ℕ M'`).

## Main results

* `reservoir_correct` — **exact uniformity**: each element is
  returned with probability `count a / |L|`. Unlike
  `Quicksort`/`Quickselect`, the output distribution is not a point
  mass, this is an example of the framework's distributional tier, the
  headline claim of the `PMF` shallow embedding.
* `reservoir_none_eq_zero` — the sampler never returns `none` on a nonempty
  list.
* `reservoir_cost_exact` / `reservoir_costPMF` — one coin per stream
  element after the first: exactly `n − 1` ticks, on every run — a
  single pass.

## Correctness: the exact output distribution

The streaming invariant: in `reservoirAux seen cur xs` the held
element survives with probability `seen/(seen+m)` and each stream
element is output with probability `1/(seen+m)` (`m = |xs|`): it wins
its `1/(seen+j)` coin and survives all later coins. Stated with
multiplicities via `List.count`, over any `LawfulRandMonad`.
-/

/-- **Streaming invariant.** The output distribution of the core loop:
`cur` weighted `seen`, every stream element weighted its multiplicity,
normalized by the total number of elements seen at the end. -/

## Complexity

One coin flip and one tick per stream element: the pass costs exactly
`|xs|` on `reservoirAux _ _ xs`, hence `n − 1` for a list of length
`n`. The cost is deterministic; the proof is the uniform-step recipe
with a constant recurrence.
