# The coupon collector

`n` coupon types, uniform independent draws: collecting every type
takes `n·H(n)` draws in expectation, the classical harmonic-number
bound, exactly.

## Modelling: a cost law, not a program

This case study deliberately bypasses the program layer, and it is
the only one that does. "Draw until a new type appears" is a retry
loop that terminates only *almost surely*, so it is not a structurally
terminating Lean program and cannot be written in the `RandMonad` /
`MonadCost` style of the other case studies; that is precisely the
expressivity gate a sub-probability layer would open.

What *is* expressible, and is the object below, is its cost law:
each stage is a `geometricTrials` distribution (the number of draws
until the current success probability `m/n` fires), and the stages
compose by `bind`. So this file exercises the framework's
distribution tier (`PMF`, `𝔼[·]`, `mean_bind_add`) rather than its
program tier, and the theorem is an exact expectation over that law.

## Main results

For `n` the number of coupon types, we have:

* `couponCollector_cost_exact`: `𝔼[draws] = Σ_{r<n} n/(r+1)`, exactly,
  in `ℝ≥0∞`.
* `couponCollector_cost_exact_real`: the classical form
  `𝔼[draws] = n·H(n)` in `ℝ`.
