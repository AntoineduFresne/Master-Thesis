# Quicksort

This module implements a modular version of Quicksort.

## Architecture

A single `Quicksort` definition is parameterized by both `RandMonad`
(for pivot selection) and `MonadCost ℕ` (for cost tracking). By
instantiating with different `MonadCost` instances, the same code
serves as:

* Untimed specification (`M = PMF`, no-op `tick`)
* Timed specification (`M = TimeMT ℕ PMF`, accumulating `tick`)
* Executable (`M = IO`, no-op `tick`)
* Executable timed (`M = TimeMT ℕ IO`, accumulating `tick`)

## Main results

For `L` the input list and `n` its length, we have:

* `quicksort_correct`: generic correctness over any
  `LawfulRandMonad`: the output distribution is the Dirac mass at
  `sortSpec L`, the algorithm deterministically returns the sorted
  list (existential form: `quicksort_correct_spec`). Proved two further
  independent ways — `quicksort_correct_spec_of_branch_spec` (route A,
  the per-branch specification collapse) and `quicksort_sorted` plus
  `quicksort_correct_spec_of_support` (route B, the support tier and
  the bridge) — to exhibit the three correctness routes the framework
  offers. Each re-derives the theorem above without appealing to it.
* `quicksort_cost_le_real`: For arbitrary lists (possibly with
  duplicates), bounds the expected cost by `C(n,2)`, tight on
  all-equal inputs. Its `ENNReal` core also supplies the finiteness
  fact needed by the exact-formula proof.
* `quicksort_cost_exact`: Quantifies the exact expected
  cost over any `LawfulRandMonad`: sorting a list of `n` distinct
  elements requires exactly `2(n+1)H(n) - 4n` comparisons.

## Notation

The expected runtime of a timed computation is written with the
`𝔼_{M}[cost e]` (or `𝔼ℝ_{M}[cost e]` for a real value) notation
from `ARA.Infrastructure.Complexity.ExpectedCost`. For example:

  `𝔼ℝ_{M}[cost Quicksort L]`

reads as "the expected runtime of Quicksort on `L`, run over the random
monad `M`, as a real number". The `| M` fixes the monad the polymorphic
`Quicksort` is instantiated at (timed via `TimeMT ℕ M`); the
`instRandMonadTimeMT` / `instMonadCostTimeMT` instances are picked up
automatically. Statements phrase the pivot partition with
`pivotLT L i` / `pivotGE L i` from `ARA.Helpers.Partition`.

### Generic correctness theorem

The specification is `sortSpec L`, the sorted list of `L`: the unique
list that is sorted and permutes `L` (`ARA.Helpers.Partition`).

Quicksort is proved correct three times, once by each collapse the
infrastructure offers, to show that the framework does not prescribe a
proof. The three differ in how much of the specification the induction
has to carry:

* The default recipe, immediately below: one `dirac_correct` call,
  which collapses with `toPMF_randIdx_bind_dirac`. Every branch must
  produce the same named value, so the specification `sortSpec L` is
  present at every step. Driven by the equational transport lemma
  `sortSpec_partition_cons`. One line, and what a new algorithm follows
  by default.

* Route A: `toPMF_randIdx_bind_dirac_spec`. Each branch produces some
  deterministic output meeting the specification, and the branches are
  not required to agree; `sortedPerm_unique` restores the agreement at
  the collapse. The induction carries a witness but never `sortSpec`.

* Route B: the support tier plus `eq_pure_of_support_subsingleton`. No
  value at all during the induction, because the support of the draw is
  a union and the branches are independent. Its branch obligation is
  literally the induction step of the textbook proof.

All three end at the same statement. `quicksort_correct_of_branch_spec`
and `quicksort_correct_of_support` close the loop by re-deriving the
first theorem from the other two, each without appealing to it.

### Route A

The same theorem with the specification value out of the induction but
a witness still in it. Each branch is shown to be deterministic and to
meet the specification — "sorted, and a permutation of the input" — and
the branches are not shown to agree. `toPMF_randIdx_bind_dirac_spec`
supplies the agreement from `sortedPerm_unique` at the moment of the
collapse.

Compared with the default recipe, this is what changes: the branch
obligation is `∃ Output, … = PMF.pure Output ∧ P Output` rather than an
equation against a named value, so the assembly step is
`sortedPerm_concat_pivot` (a property) instead of
`sortSpec_partition_cons` (an equation). Compared with route B, the
witness is still threaded through the induction; the pivot draw is
still a collapse rather than a union.

### Route B

The same theorem with no specification value in sight. The statement is
"every list `Quicksort` can output is a sorted permutation of the
input", a property of the support; the induction never carries a
witness, because the support of the pivot draw is the union of the
branch supports and the branches therefore never have to agree.

`support_step` does the framework's half: it peels the tick, pushes
`toPMF` through the two recursive calls, and turns the membership into
one binder per random choice and one per recursive call. What is left
is the mathematics, and it is exactly `sortedPerm_concat_pivot` —
the same lemma route A uses, before `eq_sortSpec` turns it into an
equation.

## Complexity

The expected cost obeys
`E[n] = (n-1) + (1/n) Σ_i (E[L1_i] + E[L2_i])`. Two results follow,
both by functional induction on `Quicksort`:

* bounding both recursive calls via discrete convexity of `C(·,2)`
  gives `E ≤ C(n,2)` for arbitrary lists (tight on all-equal inputs),
  which also yields finiteness of the expected cost;
* for distinct lists, rank reindexing turns the sum over pivots into
  the harmonic recurrence, which solves exactly to `2(n+1)H(n) − 4n`
  (`quicksort_cost_exact`).

The upper bound is stated in `ENNReal`, where no summability bookkeeping
is needed; the exact formula descends to `ℝ` via `toReal`, with
finiteness supplied by the `C(n,2)` bound.

### The `C(n,2)` bound for arbitrary lists

The closed-form `2(n+1)H(n) − 4n` requires `L.Nodup` because duplicates
shift the partition distribution. For a list with repeated keys, the
worst case is all-equal inputs `L = [a, a, …, a]`:

  pivot = a, `L1 = []`, `L2 = rest` (length `n-1`, again all `a`)

so the recurrence degenerates to `T(n) = (n-1) + T(n-1)` and yields
`T(n) = n(n-1)/2 = C(n,2)` deterministically. This is the worst case
across all inputs and pivot sequences, so the expected cost on any list
is bounded by `C(n,2)`. Its `ENNReal` form also provides finiteness of
the expected cost for free. -/

### The exact expected cost for distinct lists

`harmonic n = ∑ i ∈ Finset.range n, (↑(i + 1))⁻¹`
(`Mathlib.NumberTheory.Harmonic.Defs`). The formula `2(n+1)H(n) − 4n`
requires `L.Nodup`: duplicates shift the partition distribution
(see the `C(n,2)` section above for the degenerate worst case).
