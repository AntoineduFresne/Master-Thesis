# Timed semantics

The meaning of a `TimeMT`-timed computation — what it *outputs*, as
opposed to what it costs. Split out of `ExpectedCost` because none of
it mentions an expected value; it sits between the cost transformer
(`TimeMT`, `MonadCost`) and the cost analysis (`ExpectedCost`), which
is why it lives in `Complexity/` even though what it delivers is
correctness:

* `RandMonad (TimeMT ℕ M)` — timed programs can flip coins;
* the clock-erasure lemmas — `TimeM.ret <$> ·` distributes through
  the combinators;
* `LawfulRandMonad (TimeMT ℕ M)` — the output distribution of a
  timed program is its clock erasure, so every generic correctness
  theorem instantiates at `TimeMT ℕ PMF` for free;
* `LawfulMonadCost` — cost models whose `tick` is invisible to the
  output distribution (`toPMF_tick_bind` peels a lawful tick in one
  rewrite): one correctness statement covers every cost reading.

The payoff: timed correctness is never a separate proof obligation.

## Generic `TimeMT` erasure lemmas

Erasing time (`TimeM.ret <$> ·`) distributes through
`bind`, `pure`, `tick`, and `lift`. These four are exactly the proof
obligations of the `LawfulRandMonad (TimeMT ℕ M)` instance below and
are used there by name; they carry no `@[simp]` attribute, since
their `TimeM.ret <$> (…).run` head never occurs in a user's goal.
