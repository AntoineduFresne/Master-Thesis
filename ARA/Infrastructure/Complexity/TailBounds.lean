# Tail bounds

Markov's inequality for randomized computations: the probability that
the cost exceeds `k` is at most the expected cost divided by `k`.
This is the third analysis tier, next to correctness and expected
cost, an expected-cost theorem upgrades to a tail bound for free:

```
ℙ[cost m > k] ≤ 𝔼[cost m] / (k + 1)
```

## Main declarations

* `expected_cost_eq_expVal`: the bridge making every `expVal`
  estimate (Markov, Chebyshev) apply to running times
* `ℙ[cost m ≥ k]` / `ℙ[cost m > k]` notation
* `runtime_markov`, `runtime_markov_gt`, the first-moment cost tail
  bounds
* `runtime_chebyshev`: the second-moment cost tail bound

The event algebra (`prob`, singletons, complements, `bind`) and
Markov's inequality on `expVal` itself live one layer down in
`ARA.Infrastructure.Randomness.Prob`, together with the
output-probability notation `ℙ_{M}[e = v]`.

Since costs are `ℕ`-valued, the strict form `runtime_markov_gt`
divides by `k + 1` (via `P(cost > k) = P(cost ≥ k + 1)`): it is both
sharper than the classical `E/k` and free of any `k ≠ 0` hypothesis.

## Runtime tail bounds

`ℙ[cost m > k]` is the probability that the running time of `m`
exceeds `k`, mirroring the `𝔼[cost m]` notation. Like it, the
notation expands to the underlying `prob (TimedPMF m) {…}` form so
`simp`/`rw` can match lemmas without unfolding hints.

already-timed `m` is at least `k : ℕ`. -/

exceeds `k : ℕ`. -/
scoped macro "ℙ[cost " m:term:51 " > " k:term "]" : term =>
  `(prob (TimedPMF $m) {tm | $k < tm.time})

/-- `ℙ_{M}[cost e ≥ k]`: tail probability of the running time of the
monad-polymorphic algorithm `e`, instantiated at the random monad
`M`: the event `cost e ≥ k` under `ℙ_{M}`. -/
