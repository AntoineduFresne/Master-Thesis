# MonadCost

A typeclass for monads with a cost-charging operation.

## Design

`MonadCost C M` provides a single operation `tick : C → M Unit`.
By varying the instance, the same algorithm
can run in cost-free mode (where `tick` is a no-op) or in timed mode
(where `tick` accumulates cost).

This eliminates the need to write each algorithm twice (untimed and
timed), reducing code duplication and ensuring the control-flow logic
is verified exactly once.

## Main declarations

* `MonadCost`: the typeclass
* `instMonadCostDefault`: blanket no-op instance (low priority)
* `instMonadCostTimeMT`: `TimeMT` instance that accumulates cost

for any cost type `T`. Higher priority than the default no-op
instance. -/
