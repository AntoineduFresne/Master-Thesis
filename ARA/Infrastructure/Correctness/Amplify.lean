# Amplification

Success amplification for Monte-Carlo algorithms: `amplify best k m`
runs `m` `k` times independently and combines the answers with `best`.
If a single run succeeds with probability at least `p`, and `best`
keeps a success when it sees one, the amplified run succeeds with
probability at least

```
1 − (1 − p) ^ k
```

so the failure probability decays geometrically in the number of runs
This is the "repeat and keep the best" argument, proved once and inherited by
every Monte-Carlo algorithm (`karger_amplified` is the first client).

The hypotheses are phrased on an invariant set `V` containing the
support of one run, typically supplied by the algorithm's one-sided
correctness theorem ("every output is at least the minimum cut"):

* `hclosed`: `best` does not leave `V`;
* `hkeep`: on `V`, `best` returns a success as soon as either
  argument is one.

## Main declarations

* `amplify`: `k` independent runs combined with `best`
* `support_amplify_subset`: one-sided correctness survives
  amplification
* `prob_amplify_compl_le`: the failure product `q ^ k`
* `amplify_success`: the amplification theorem `1 − (1 − p) ^ k`
* `amplify_min_success` / `amplify_max_success`: the ready-made form
  for one-sided algorithms on a linear order: the hypotheses are
  exactly the support and success theorems such an algorithm already
  provides
* `expected_cost_amplify`: `k + 1` runs cost `k + 1` times one run

Statements are phrased with the `ℙ[m ∈ S]` / `ℙ[m = v]` notation from
`ARA.Infrastructure.Complexity.TailBounds`.

the answers with `best`. `k = 0` degenerates to a single run: a

/-- `amplify_success` for a Boolean one-sided test. If one run of
`m` answers `true` with probability at least `p`, then `k` independent
runs combined with `||` answer `true` with probability at least
`1 − (1 − p) ^ k`.

No support hypothesis is needed: `||` keeps a `true` wherever it finds
one, so the invariant set is everything. This is the combiner of a
test that never says `true` in error, which seems to be the commonest
Monte-Carlo shape. -/

/-- `amplify_success` for one-sided algorithms that return a
witness. If every output of `m` has measure at least `c` and `m`
attains `c` with probability at least `p`, then keeping the
smallest-measure answer over `k` independent runs attains `c` with
probability at least `1 − (1 − p) ^ k`.

This is the shape a Monte-Carlo algorithm that returns a witness
(Karger returns a cut, not a number) needs; `amplify_min_success` is
the special case `f = id`, where the witness is its own measure. -/
