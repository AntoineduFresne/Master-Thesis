# Correctness recipes for randomized algorithms

This module packages the generic, algorithm-independent part of a
correctness proof, so that verifying a new uniform-pivot algorithm
reduces to its mathematical content: how the specification interacts
with one branch of the algorithm.

## Dirac correctness (Las Vegas algorithms)

An algorithm is Dirac-correct when its output distribution is a
point mass at the specification value. The recipe for proving
`toPMF (myAlgo args) = PMF.pure (spec args)`:

1. Spec-transport lemmas, the mathematics. For each branch, prove
   how the specification commutes with it (e.g. `orderStat_lt_branch`:
   "if the rank falls in the `<`-side, the order statistic of `L` is
   the order statistic of that side"). Tag them `@[spec_transport]`.
2. Induct. `induction args using myAlgo.induct`, then expose the pivot
   choice with the algorithm's `_eq_bind` decomposition lemma.
3. Collapse. `refine toPMF_randIdx_bind_dirac fun i => ?_` reduces
   the goal to a single branch at a fixed pivot `i`.
4. Discharge the branch. `toPMF_step` pushes `toPMF` through the
   monadic structure (lawful `tick`s vanish, `bind`/`pure`
   distribute). Close each case with the inductive hypotheses and the
   transport lemmas, or try `dirac_finish`, which attempts all of
   step 4 at once and leaves open exactly the missing mathematics.

## Distributional correctness (Monte Carlo algorithms)

When the output is genuinely random (e.g. `Karger`), correctness is a
property of the distribution: typically a support statement
(one-sided error) plus a success-probability bound, and for the exact
tier the full output law. The recipe mirrors the Dirac one. Unfold,
peel (`toPMF_step` / `toPMF_tick_bind`), uniform-average the pivot,
discharge each branch and count, with these generic primitives:

* `toPMF_randIdx_bind_apply`: the output probability is the uniform
  average of the branch probabilities (probabilistic analogue of
  `expected_cost_uniform_step`);
* `le_toPMF_randIdx_bind`: lower-bound the success probability by a
  single good pivot;
* `support_toPMF_randIdx_bind`: the support is the union of the
  branch supports;
* `toPMF_bind_pure_apply` / `toPMF_map_apply` (+ their `_eq_zero`
  off-range forms): pure post-processing along an injective function
  just transports probabilities;
* `mem_support_toPMF_bind_pure`: the support of a post-processed
  computation is the image of the support.

### Dirac correctness without a named specification value

`toPMF_randIdx_bind_dirac` asks the caller to name the output. Often
the specification is more naturally a property that happens to have
exactly one solution — "the sorted list", "the `k`-th smallest element"
— and naming a value up front is then working against the grain.

The two constructions below let a proof work with the property and
recover the value at the end. They are alternatives, not stages of one
recipe:

* Route A (`toPMF_randIdx_bind_dirac_spec`) keeps the collapse at
  the uniform draw, but weakens what each branch must supply: any
  deterministic output meeting the specification, rather than one
  agreed value. Uniqueness of the specification restores the agreement.
  Use it when the branch reasoning is naturally equational, so that the
  existing `@[spec_transport]` machinery still applies.
* Route B (support tier, then `eq_pure_of_support_subsingleton`)
  drops the value entirely for the duration of the induction and
  restores it once at the end. Use it when the branch reasoning is
  naturally a property.

Route B is the one that inducts most cleanly, and the reason is
structural rather than aesthetic: the support of a uniform draw is the
union of the branch supports (`support_toPMF_randIdx_bind`), so the
branches never have to agree on anything and each is discharged in
isolation. Route A and the plain Dirac collapse both require every
branch to produce the same value, which is a genuine extra obligation.

Both are provided because the framework is not meant to prescribe one
proof. An algorithm may use either; `Quicksort` carries both, once as
each, precisely to show that the choice is free.
-/

/-- Dirac collapse, specification form (route A). Each branch is known
to be deterministic and to meet the specification `P`, but the
branches are not known to agree on a value; uniqueness of
`P`-solutions supplies the agreement.

Generalizes `toPMF_randIdx_bind_dirac`, which is the special case
`P := (· = out)`. -/

  refine ⟨out, toPMF_randIdx_bind_dirac fun i => ?_, hP⟩
  obtain ⟨out', hout', hP'⟩ := h i
  rwa [huniq out' out hP' hP] at hout'

/-- Support-to-Dirac bridge (route B, closing step). If every reachable
output satisfies `P` and `P` has at most one solution, the computation
is deterministic and its value is that solution.

This is the edge between the two correctness tiers of the framework:
Dirac correctness is support correctness plus uniqueness of the
specification. Tier 1 is therefore not an independent notion, it is
tier 3 with an extra hypothesis about the specification — which is also
why a Las Vegas algorithm and a Monte Carlo algorithm with a
single-valued answer are proved by the same induction.

`huniq` is the mathematics that a named specification value hides. For
sorting it is `sortedPerm_unique`: two sorted permutations of the same
list are equal. -/

compiler-generated `myAlgo.eq_1`. This is the twin of `cost_step`'s

    fun _ => ⟨a, inst.toPMF_pure a, rfl⟩

/-! ### Automation for the support tier

`toPMF_step` pushes `toPMF` inwards and leaves a membership standing,
which is what Dirac and pointwise proofs want. A support proof wants
the membership taken apart: `out ∈ (𝒟[…]).support` should become an
existential over the branch outputs, one binder per random choice and
one per recursive call, so that the inductive hypotheses apply directly
to the pieces.

`support_step` is that normalizer. It reuses `toPMF_simp` (so lawful
ticks still vanish and `bind`/`pure` still distribute) and adds
`support_simp`, which turns the surviving memberships into existentials
and discharges the uniform draw outright.

What it deliberately does not do is the mathematics. After
`support_step`, a Quicksort branch reads "`S1` is in the support of the
recursive call on the `<`-side, `S2` on the `≥`-side, and the output is
`S1 ++ pivot :: S2`" — the induction step of the textbook proof, with
the randomness gone. Closing it is the user's `@[spec_preserve]` lemma,
exactly as `@[spec_transport]` is for the Dirac tier. The difference in
kind is worth stating: `spec_transport` lemmas are equations, which is
why `simp` alone can chain them and why `dirac_correct` is one line;
`spec_preserve` lemmas are implications, which `simp` cannot chain, so
the support tier gets an unpacker rather than a one-shot tactic. -/

  | `(tactic| support_step $f:ident $loc:location) =>
    `(tactic| (simp only [$f:ident] $loc:location; support_step $loc:location))

/-- `support_finish` closes a support-tier branch: unpack the
membership with `support_step`, then chain the `@[spec_preserve]` pool
forward against the inductive hypotheses with `grind`.

`grind`, not `simp`. This is the whole asymmetry between the two tiers.
A `@[spec_transport]` lemma is an equation, `simp` rewrites with
equations, and that is why `dirac_correct` is one line; a
`@[spec_preserve]` lemma is an implication, which `simp` cannot chain
at all. `grind`'s E-matching can, so the support tier does get a
one-shot closer — but by search rather than by rewriting, and the
difference is worth knowing:

* it costs more (a `grind` call is roughly an order of magnitude
  slower than the explicit `obtain`/`exact` script it replaces);
* it must stay `only`-scoped. Unrestricted `grind` on a support goal
  in this framework hits the heartbeat limit at `isDefEq`;
* a failure is a failed search, not a stuck rewrite, so it reports no
  trace of what it tried. If it does not close, write the branch out.

`support_finish f at h` first unfolds the branch abbreviation `f`, the
same ident form `support_step` and `toPMF_step` take. When a branch
needs a fact outside the algorithm's `spec_preserve` set, drop to
`grind only [spec_preserve, extra]` by hand. -/
