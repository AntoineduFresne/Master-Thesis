# Sub-probability and Las Vegas retry: `SPMF`

`PMF` forces total mass `1`, so a genuine retry-until-success loop was
not a program the framework could express (objective 2g; the design
comparison lives in `archive/notes/spmf-design.md` — this file
implements its recommendation).

* The carrier is `SPMF := OptionT PMF`: total mass stays `1`, with
  `none` carrying the **divergence** probability — so the monad and
  its laws are free (`OptionT` of a lawful monad), and the type is
  equivalent to the textbook sub-probability monad
  `{f : α → ℝ≥0∞ // ∑' f ≤ 1}` (missing mass ↦ `none`).
* `retry good p` is **conditioning, not domain theory**: the loop
  re-runs exactly the retryable failures (`some a` with `¬ good a`),
  so its law is `p` conditioned on `retryEvent good` = "success or
  divergence" (`PMF.filter`); the geometric series `∑ₖ rᵏ = (1−r)⁻¹`
  is absorbed by the normalization. When nothing can succeed or
  diverge the loop runs forever: `pure none`.
* `RetryMonad` makes `retry` a *program* primitive with one definition
  and two readings: under `IO` it is an actual loop (`retryIO`), under
  `SPMF` it is the conditional law.

## Main declarations / results

* `SPMF`, `SPMF.mass` — the carrier and its termination probability.
* `RandMonad (OptionT M)` — any polymorphic algorithm runs inside.
* `RetryMonad` with instances for `IO` and `SPMF`.
* `retry_run_some_of_good` / `retry_run_some_of_not_good` — the output
  law: good outcomes keep their probability, renormalized by
  `prob … (retryEvent good)`; non-good outcomes are impossible
  (one-sided correctness of the loop).
* `mass_retry_eq_one` — **the Las Vegas theorem**: retrying a total
  program with positive success probability terminates almost surely.

The cost reading (`TimeMT ℕ SPMF`, expected trials `1/p` via
`geometricTrials`) and the program-level coupon collector are the
intended next clients; the lawfulness bridge for an `M`-level `retry`
(`LawfulRetryMonad`) waits for them.
