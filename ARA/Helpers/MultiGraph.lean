# Executable undirected multigraphs: cuts and contraction

Pure graph theory, shared by the contraction algorithms (`Karger`, and
sparsification to come). Nothing here
mentions randomness, cost, or `PMF`: it is Mathlib-only mathematics,
and it is the part of the Karger development that ARA does not
claim as its own contribution.

## Standing in for GraphLib

This file is a deliberate stand-in for `sorrachai/GraphLib`, which is
not yet importable (its branches are on `v4.30.0-rc2`, ours is
`v4.31.0`, and `main` has no cut theory yet). The definitions are
aligned with it so the eventual swap is mechanical:

* endpoints are `Sym2 α`, matching GraphLib's `Edge.endpoints`
  (`GraphLib/Graph/Basic.lean`) and Weixuan Yuan's `abbrev Edge := Sym2`;
* `WF` is their `incidence` / `loopless` pair;
* `redirect`/`contractEdge` follow their `redirectEdge`/`contract`, and
  redirection acts through `Sym2.map` as in their `mapEdge`.

Two divergences, both forced by executability and documented at their
definitions: multiplicity is carried by repetition in a `List` rather
than by an `Edge.edgeLabel` over a noncomputable `Set` (our
`List (Sym2 α)` is their `Set (Edge α (Fin m))` with the list position
as the label), and contraction merges the two endpoints into a vertex
of the same type, chosen by the caller, rather than into a quotient of
the vertex type by a `Setoid`: the vertex type survives the
contraction loop.

When GraphLib publishes on a matching toolchain, this file should
shrink to an adapter.

/-! ## The multigraph model -/

/-- An undirected multigraph: a vertex set plus an edge list, with
parallel edges repeated (one entry per copy) and no loops.

Endpoints are a `Sym2 α`, Mathlib's unordered pair, matching GraphLib's
`Edge.endpoints` (`GraphLib/Graph/Basic.lean`) and Weixuan's
`abbrev Edge := Sym2`. Orientation is therefore not merely irrelevant,
it is inexpressible: `s(u, v)` and `s(v, u)` are the same term.

We diverge from GraphLib on multiplicity only. GraphLib distinguishes
parallel edges by an `edgeLabel` and stores edges in a `Set`, which is
noncomputable; here an edge is repeated once per copy in a `List`, so
that drawing an edge uniformly with multiplicity is just
`randFin edges.length` and the development stays executable. Our
`List (Sym2 α)` is exactly GraphLib's `Set (Edge α (Fin m))` with the
list position playing the role of the label. -/

/-! ### Cuts

Ported from GraphLib's `Cuts/Basic.lean` (`Cut`, `weight`,
`isSTCut`, `stMinCutValue`), specialized to unweighted multigraphs:
the weight of a cut is the number of crossing edges, counted with
multiplicity. -/

/-- The crossing test, as a `Bool`, built with `Sym2.lift`. The
symmetry argument is the well-definedness obligation of the lift, so
a direction-sensitive crossing predicate cannot even be written down,
this is what makes the model undirected by construction rather than by
after-the-fact proof. -/

/-! ### Degrees and the handshake bound

The key quantitative fact behind Karger's analysis: every vertex
degree is at least the minimum-cut value (its singleton is a cut), so
`n * minCut ≤ Σ deg = 2 * m`. Note `degree` is the incidence degree
(`v ∈ e` for the unordered edge `e`), which is why the handshake
identity below reads `2 * m` and not `m`. -/

/-! ### Generic endpoint-merge (rename) contraction

Every representative-style contraction has the same shape: the two
endpoints of the contracted edge leave the vertex set, a single merged
vertex `w` enters, every edge is redirected through the merge, and the
loops this creates (the parallel copies of the contracted edge) are
dropped. The models differ only in how `w` is chosen: the smaller
endpoint under a linear order, the endpoint of smaller label under an
upfront enumeration, or a brand-new vertex.

The entire cut theory needs exactly one hypothesis about that
choice: `w` collides with no untouched vertex,
`w ∉ g.verts.filter (· ∉ e)`, since `w` may well be one of the endpoints.
Everything else (cut lifting, cut survival, preservation of the
minimum-cut value along a non-crossing contraction) is proved here
once, and each model instantiates it by discharging the freshness
obligation, which is precisely where each model pays its price. -/
